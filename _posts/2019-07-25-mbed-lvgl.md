# Using LittlevGL with Mbed-OS

**Note: This post assumes you are familiar with configuring/building Mbed-OS applications. See [Getting Started with Mbed-OS here.](https://os.mbed.com/getting-started/)**

## Graphics/UI in Embedded Systems

Implementing graphics and UI present a unique challenge to resource-constrained embedded systems. Graphics are particularly data-intensive, with memory and processing demands increasing dramatically with display resolution and UI complexity. There’s no shortage of GUI libraries available for typical desktop applications, but these are obviously unsuitable for systems with RAM on the order of kilobytes.

Thankfully, there are several GUI libraries specifically for embedded systems. When I was deciding what library to go with for initial prototypes of [Quic](www.quic.ly), I tried out a couple since it would be a major component of my firmware stack.

A quick google turned up a few options, including [SEGGER emWin](https://www.segger.com/products/user-interface/emwin/), [TARA Embedded Wizard](https://www.embedded-wizard.de/), [uGFX](https://ugfx.io/), and [LittlevGL](https://littlevgl.com/). Since my applications were fairly simple, I shied away from the more complex, commercial libraries, emWin and Embedded Wizard. I didn’t evaluate these two libraries beyond reading their features and pricing… and that’s where I pretty much stopped. If I ever wanted to sell one of my projects I didn’t want to be locked into a framework that could cost more than $10,000/seat. I’m sure they are both very full-featured and robust, maybe I would consider them if I was working on a barista robot or some other major commercial application.

That leaves the other two libraries which seemed to fit the complexity of my projects much better anyway — not to mention their more reasonable pricing scheme.
uGFX boasts many of the features advertised by SEGGER and TARA, but charges less than $2,000 for an unlimited commercial license. I actually did download uGFX and start to play around with it in it’s nifty simulator. 

Ultimately, I didn’t see much difference between the features uGFX and LittlevGL advertised. And since LittlevGL is completely free (even for commercial use) I decided to give it a shot. I also like contributing to open-source projects so it’s a win-win. One of the only advantages uGFX advertised over LittlevGL is a GUI-builder application called uGFX-studio -- which has been in a private beta since I first looked over a year ago. I have since started working on a python/QT-based [GUI builder for LittlevGL](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_gui_builder/tree/initial-development) -- it's not quite ready yet but it's getting there! Contributions are welcome!

LittlevGL’s main author, Gabor Kiss-Vámosi, has already gone through the trouble of writing a bunch of [getting started guides](https://littlevgl.com/get-started). This post is more about integrating LittlevGL into my preferred RTOS/driver platform, [Mbed-OS](https://www.mbed.com/en/platform/mbed-os/) from ARM (another free, open-source project).

## Porting LittlevGL

One of my favorite aspects of LittlevGL is just how portable it really is. It is truly surprising how little effort it takes to adapt LittlevGL to other targets, platforms, and hardware combinations. For getting basic UI up and running on a new display, there are only a few simple steps:

1.	Configure your lv_conf.h file — LittlevGL allows you to disable unneeded modules to save precious RAM/ROM
2.	Call lv_init()
3.	If not already available in the lv_drivers repo, implement a driver for your display (this is the hardest part and is usually necessary regardless of UI library)
4.	Provide a `lv_disp_drv_t` struct filled out with function pointers to your driver implementation.
5.	Set up a periodic ticker to call `lv_tick_inc()` (easy if you have an RTOS)
6.	Call `lv_task_handler()` periodically in your main application to process LittlevGL events. (also easy to spin off a dedicated thread if you have an RTOS)
7.	Start creating the UI!

Essentially you just need to initialize LittlevGL, tell it how to draw to your display, and then give it processor time periodically to process events. Adding an input device (like a touchscreen) is a similar process; the hardest part is writing the input device driver (if you can’t find one written by someone else!).

Porting LittlevGL is dead simple if you are already using an RTOS. That’s where Mbed-OS comes in.

## Mbed-OS

[Mbed-OS](https://www.mbed.com/en/platform/mbed-os/), straight from ARM, is my favorite embedded platform. It combines a CMSIS-compliant RTOS with hardware-abstracted drivers and libraries that enable you to quickly get started on any of the hundreds of supported targets. They have made embedded programming very beginner-friendly by offering an online IDE/toolchain, drag-and-drop programming, and C++ APIs for all their modules that yield incredibly readable code. 

Many times this kind of simplification hinders developers with more experience and more advanced requirements (see Arduino as a prime example, but that rant is for another post). With Mbed-OS, this isn’t the case. As long as you are mindful of the resources/peripherals used and configured by Mbed-OS, you can code as close to the hardware as you want. 

This is what makes Mbed-OS great; it offers tested, uniform modules/APIs for common tasks you normally have to learn and rewrite for each target (setting up UART, micro/millisecond delays, storing data in flash, etc) while also allowing you to fully utilize the underlying hardware. Mbed-OS also makes embedded C/C++ development more like typical desktop-based C/C++ by retargeting function calls like `printf` and typical file I/O operations -- LittlevGL's default file system port pretty much works out of the box!

## LittlevGL on Mbed-OS

When it comes to coding style, I prefer the readability offered by C++. So when I was porting LittlevGL to Mbed-OS, I decided to make a C++ API/framework for LittlevGL. It’s still in development but you can check it out (and maybe even contribute)[on GitHub](https://github.com/AGlass0fMilk/mbed-lvgl). In this post, I’ll provide an overview of my LittlevGL/Mbed-OS framework as I implement a custom display driver for the sweet [Noritake Itron graphic vacuum-fluorescent-displays](https://youtu.be/4J73IhPjz5U) I picked up for one of my personal projects.

### uDisplay Framework

Under the hood of the mbed-lvgl port is another project of mine -- [uDisplay](https://github.com/AGlass0fMilk/uDisplay). uDisplay began as a part of mbed-lvgl; I decided to split off uDisplay to make the code more reusable. The motivation was so other developers could use the diplay drivers built on Mbed even if they didn't want to use the full-blown mbed-lvgl graphics solution. This way, mbed-lvgl is another optional layer of additional functionality if the hardware can support it and if the application requires it.

#### `DisplayDriver and DisplayInterface`

In many cases, a display supports multiple interfaces for transferring framebuffer/command data (UART, SPI, MIPI-DSI, i8080 Parallel… the list goes on). Oftentimes the data/commands being transferred are the same!

To account for this, uDisplay has a few abstract parent classes. Specifically, `DisplayDriver` and `DisplayInterface`. 

Essentially, a `DisplayDriver` subclass encapsulates the command-set a display uses. The `DisplayDriver` class is currently pretty sparse. 

A `DisplayDriver` is instantiated with a `DisplayInterface`. The `DisplayInterface` API provides a common way of transferring data/commands regardless of the actual hardware/protocol used. This structure allows you to prototype with pre-made interfaces and then provide your own interface when you’re ready to optimize using all the features your hardware has available (DMA, hardware acceleration, etc). 

#### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Additionally, the library includes a hardware-abstraction-layer (HAL) that mirrors the structure of Mbed-OS. This allows you to write reusable HAL API specifications for hardware display interfaces that are less common. On top of the HAL lies a C++ `DisplayInterface` that uses the target-specific HAL implementation.

As an example, some displays have the option of using a parallel bus to achieve much faster frame rates than what's possible with a serial protocl like I2C or SPI.

A generic 8-bit parallel bus could use Mbed's [`BusOut`](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.9/reference/busout.html) API for universal target support. However, since transferring every piece of data requires interaction from the processor the transfer speeds would probably be abysmal. This is fine for simple proof-of-concepts, but if you're working with a large or high-resolution display you'll want to be able to optimize using your hardware's unique features.

uDisplay enables this kind of optimization by providing a HAL.

**Note: The rest of this section discusses a feature that is not yet merged into master as of 7/30/2019.**

STM32F4 devices have a peripheral called the [“Flexible Static Memory Controller” (FSMC)](https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/training/technical/product_training/e0/de/1c/48/51/a9/4e/2e/STM32L4_Memory_FSMC.pdf/files/STM32L4_Memory_FSMC.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.STM32L4_Memory_FSMC.pdf) that enables extremely fast, memory-mapped access to a parallel bus that can be used with a DMA -- taking the processor out of the equation. Normally it’s used for external RAM or program memory, but it also works with some display driver ICs.

The HAL API is found in uDisplay/hal. If a target’s hardware supports an interface, the corresponding HAL implementation will be found in mbed-lvgl/targets/TARGET_<XXX>. Mbed’s build system automatically searches directories based on the configured target, so compiling the correct HAL implementation is already taken care of. The HAL implementation is used by a common C++ API for the interface, in this case Parallel8Bit. Now, if you want to add support for i8080 transfers on a certain platform you just have to implement the HAL API!

### `mbed-lvgl` Structure

The `mbed-lvgl` library adapts uDisplay's framework to LittlevGL and encapsulates the code for initializing and running LittlevGL on Mbed's RTOS. `mbed-lvgl` can also be configured using Mbed's [compile-time configuration system.](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.13/reference/configuration.html).

#### Configuring `mbed-lvgl`

All LittlevGL parameters are configurable through Mbed's compile-time configuration system using JSON. Otherwise, configuring LittlevGL is the same as with the vanilla library. You can read the docs [for that process here](https://docs.littlevgl.com/en/html/porting/project.html#config-file).

#### `LVGLDisplayDriver` Class

The `LVGLDisplayDriver` class provides the functions LittlevGL needs in order to interface with your display. It implements the display driver API [found here](https://docs.littlevgl.com/en/html/porting/display.html#display-driver).

The intent is to subclass an existing `DisplayDriver` from the uDisplay library. This extra class layer adds a little complexity but makes the overall structure more modular. A base `DisplayDriver` may be used without LittlevGL (useful for small bootloader applications where a full UI subsystem isn't needed). The `LVGLDisplayDriver` layer also allows developers to override the way LittlevGL writes to the RAM display buffer for special cases. This is useful with grayscale or monochrome displays where pixel data layout and bit-width varies drastically between driver chips (this feature was used in [this example here](https://blog.littlevgl.com/2019-05-06/oled)).

#### `LittlevGL` Class

The `LittlevGL` class encapsulates the boilerplate initialization code needed to run LittlevGL in Mbed's RTOS. It is implemented as a singleton.
