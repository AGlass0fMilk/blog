# What is Micropython?

Micropython is Python for microcontrollers.  
With Micropython you can write Python3 code and run it on bare metal architectures with limited resources.

### Micropython highlights

- **Compact** - fit and run within just 256k of code space and 16k of RAM.
- **Compatible** - strives to be as compatible as possible with normal Python (known as CPython)
- **Verstile** - Supports many architectures (x86, x86-64, ARM, ARM Thumb, Xtensa)
- **Iteractive** - No need for the compile-flash-boot cycle. With the REPL (interactive prompt) you can type commands, run scripts etc.
- **Popular** - More users and more platform supported. Notable forks: CircuitPython,
