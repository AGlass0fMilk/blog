LCD for iPod Nano6 uses MIPI Display Serial Interface (MIPI DSI) which is a high-speed serial interface between a host processor and a display module. LCDs belong to this category are very common for smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches. Reference is available from MIPI alliance page at https://www.mipi.org/specifications/dsi. Some MIPI LCDs are shown here.

Google the keyword MIPI specification pops up several pdf documents of something like hundred pages. It is always fun to learn from specifications like this - http://bfiles.chinaaet.com/justlxy/blog/20171114/1000019445-6364627609238902374892404.pdf.
It states "MIPI DSI specifies the interface between a host processor and a display... building on existing MIPI alliance... finally a picture like below shows up that I can finally understand.

If a 100-pages specification takes too much time, this is all you need to know about MIPI D'PHY RX<br>

There are several versions of MIPI DSI from DSI 1.0 to DSI-2 1.0, 5 versions. Transmission speed ranges from 1.0Gbps/lane to 4.5Gbps/lane with 1-4 data lane plus 1 clock signal, all in differential buses. Voltage swing driven by the difference buses is also different from RGB/MCU-typed MCU. For MIPI DSI there are high-speed (HS) and low-speed (LS) modes driving 200mV peak-to-peak and 1.2V respectively. For RGB/MCU-typed LCDs data is carried with single-ended signals matching VDDIO to its MCU host.<br>
Table below summaries the difference.<br>

Interface of a MIPI LCD needs much less pins and lower voltage than its MCU/RGB counterpart.

The problem is, how are we going to drive a MIPI display when there is no DSI output from our MCU (like ESP32) and how to port it to LittlevGL? Here comes the MIPI bridge IC - SSD2805, which is an interface chip to convert between RGB/8080 video signal to MIPI signal.

In this article I am going to hack the 1.54" 240*240 iPod Nano6 LCD with an ESP32. Its block diagram is shown below.
