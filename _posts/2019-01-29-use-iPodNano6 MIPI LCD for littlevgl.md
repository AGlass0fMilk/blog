LCD for iPod Nano6 uses MIPI Display Serial Interface (MIPI DSI) which is a high-speed serial interface between a host processor and a display module. LCDs belong to this category are very common for smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches. Reference is available from MIPI alliance page at https://www.mipi.org/specifications/dsi. Some MIPI LCDs are shown here.

Google the keyword MIPI specification pops up several pdf documents of something like hundred pages. It is always fun to learn from specifications like this - http://bfiles.chinaaet.com/justlxy/blog/20171114/1000019445-6364627609238902374892404.pdf.
It states "MIPI DSI specifies the interface between a host processor and a display... building on existing MIPI alliance... finally a picture like below shows up that I can finally understand.

If a 100-pages specification takes too much time, this is all you need to know about MIPI D'PHY RX<br>

There are several versions of MIPI DSI from DSI 1.0 to DSI-2 1.0, 5 versions. Transmission speed ranges from 1.0Gbps/lane to 4.5Gbps/lane with 1-4 data lane plus 1 clock signal, all in differential buses. Voltage swing driven by the difference buses is also different from RGB/MCU-typed MCU. For MIPI DSI there are high-speed (HS) and low-speed (LS) modes driving 200mV peak-to-peak and 1.2V respectively. For RGB/MCU-typed LCDs data is carried with single-ended signals matching VDDIO to its MCU host.<br>
Table below summaries the difference.<br>

Interface of a MIPI LCD needs much less pins and lower voltage than its MCU/RGB counterpart.

The problem is, how are we going to drive a MIPI display when there is no DSI output from our MCU (like ESP32) and how to port it to LittlevGL? Here comes the MIPI bridge IC - SSD2805, which is an interface chip to convert between RGB/8080 video signal to MIPI signal.<br> ![](https://github.com/techtoys/blog/blob/master/assets/iPodNano6/SSD2805_top.jpg)<br>
This is a very tiny chip of 5*5mm with 0.5mm pitch BGA!<br>

In this article I am going to hack the 1.54" 240*240 iPod Nano6 LCD with an ESP32 with a port to LittlevGL. Its block diagram is shown below.<br>

ESP32 is programmed with ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework). Its installation procedure is described in full details at https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html. My host computer is a Windows 7 Pro SP1 64-bit Operating System. Hardware is an old Intel Core i5 with 8GB RAM. I have followed the default installation path described in ESP-IDF's Getting Started Guide. It gives me back a mingw32.exe application under C:\msys32\.<br>

At first I was not comfortable with command line tool like mingw32.exe. So I have spent almost two days to install Eclipse IDE with innumerable Google searches trying to make it work. Unfortunately all hours in Eclipse became futile. At the end I found the time spent on configuring Eclipse was even more than programming itself so I just gave it up. Don't mean Eclipse is bad. It is just me not able to get it work.<br>
Because there is no standard evaluation kit for ESP32 + SSD2805 + MIPI Display combo, I was forced to use jumper cables to wire up things on hands with mess like this :(<br>
