## What has happened since v5.2?
* Espressif [officially supports](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32_Modules_Now_Support_LittlevGL_and_%CE%BCGFX) LittlevGL as a GUI library for ESP32. Read more [in this post](https://blog.littlevgl.com/2019-01-31/esp32).
* [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/), a popular RTOS for IoT, has integrated LittlevGL. Here is [getting started example](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/gui/lvgl/README.html).
* LittlevGL is getting more popular. According to the GitHub statistics LittlevGL is cloned in every 10 minutes. (Not counting direct downloaded from [littlevgl.com](https://littlevgl.com/download))
* LittlevGL was a [Top trending repository](https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl/issues/771) of GitHub. It means it was among the top 25 most popular repositories even if compared with all languages not only C.

## Micropython support
Thanks to @amirgon,  from now you can use LittlevGL with [Micropython](http://micropython.org/) (a Python implementation for embedded systems). Read more [in this post](https://blog.littlevgl.com/2019-02-20/micropython-bindings). You can try it on Linux and or with ESP32 using this [ready to use repository](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_micropython).

## New objects:
- **lv_tileview** container for smartwatch like designs
- **lv_spinbox** set numeric value with `+` and `-` buttons or keys
- **lv_table** create lightweight tables
- **lv_canvas** draw to a buffer and display it as an image

## New object features
- **lv_obj** add realign feature (save the last `lv_obj_align` data and re-apply)
- **lv_obj** add `lv_obj_align_origo` to align the center of the object (work with realign)
- **lv_chart** `LV_CHART_TYPE_VERTICAL_LINE` when the point count is equal to the chart width to draw only vertical lines
- **lv_chart**  lv_chart: add `LV_CHART_POINT_DEF` special value to not draw a point
- **lv_sw** animated move (`lv_sw_set_anim_time()`, `lv_sw_on/off_anim()`)
- **lv_btnm** add `lv_btnm_get_pressed()`
- **lv_btnm** add recolor feature with `lv_btnm_set_recolor` 
- **lv_ta** support `LV_GROUP_KEY_BACKSPACE`
- **lv_ddlist** add down arrow symbol option with  `lv_ddlist_set_draw_arrow`
- **lv_ddlist** add ability to set label alignment 
- **lv_list** remeber the last seleceted button (only if the list is in a group)
- **lv_list** allow single button selection mode
- **lv_list, lv_ta, lv_page** scroll propagation feature to scroll the parent on "overscrolling"
- **lv_list, lv_ta, lv_page** edge flash effect to show circle on the edge on  "overscrolling"
- **lv_preload** add `lv_preload_set_animation_type()` and `LV_PRELOAD_TYPE_FILLSPIN_ARC`
- **lv_imgbtn** add tiled option to set width dynamically by repeating the middle part
- **lv_calendar** add `lv_calendar_get_pressed_date`
- **lv_tabview** add `lv_tabview_set_hidden` to hidet tab buttons

## New other features
- **lv_lang** multi-langue interface to change UI's language run-time
- **lv_group** add `LV_GROUP_KEY_BACKSPACE`
- **lv_anim** add overshoot and bounce path
- **lv_anim** add `add lv_anim_count_running`
- **lv_anim** lv_anim: add lv_anim_count_running
- **lv_indev** add `lv_indev_set_feeback` to add callback when something happened with an object
- **lv_vdb** add true double bufferig feature to work woth only frame buffer address swapping
- **lv_style** add `LV_BORDER_INTERNAL` to remove the borders on teh edges
- **lv_porting** add display, indev, file siystem porting skeleton function√∫

## Plans for v6.0
- Multi-display support
- Run time screen configuration (instead of hard coded defines)
- Generic action handling (`lv_obj` will have an action)
- Better GPU handling
- Image rotation
- Better internationalization support (i18n)
